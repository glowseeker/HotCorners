# Hot Corners

Hot Corners is a small Python script that allows you to execute hotkeys triggered by moving the mouse cursor to specific corners of the screen.

Contribution and help is appreciated, this is my first attempt at building a python app with a GUI and packing it as a binary file.


## Features

- Currently two hotkeys (bottom corners: show desktop, top corners: previous window)
- Start and stop the hot corners detection
- Minimizes to tray

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages: `pyautogui`, `screeninfo`, `pystray`, `Pillow`

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

``git clone https://github.com/your-username/hot-corners.git``

2. Install the required packages:

``pip install pyautogui screeninfo pystray Pillow``
